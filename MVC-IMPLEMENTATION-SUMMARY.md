# MVC Architecture Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture implementation in the Notification Project.

## Overview

The Notification Project has been fully migrated to follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. This architecture separates the application into three main components:

1. **Models**: Handle data-related logic and database operations
2. **Views**: Handle the presentation layer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript in the public directory)
3. **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses, connecting the views with the models

## Implementation Details

### Models

Models handle all data-related logic and database operations. They are responsible for:

- Fetching data from the database
- Validating data
- Implementing business logic
- Updating data in the database

All models are located in the `models/` directory:

- `daysSinceModel.js`: Handles days since events
- `goalModel.js`: Handles goals
- `habitModel.js`: Handles habits
- `habitResetModel.js`: Handles daily habit progress reset
- `notificationModel.js`: Handles notifications
- `recipeModel.js`: Handles recipes
- `taskModel.js`: Handles tasks
- `weightModel.js`: Handles weight goals and logs
- `workoutModel.js`: Handles workouts, exercises, and progress photos

### Controllers

Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses. They are responsible for:

- Processing incoming requests
- Validating request parameters
- Calling the appropriate model methods
- Formatting and sending responses

All controllers are located in the `controllers/` directory:

- `daysSinceController.js`: Handles days since events requests
- `goalController.js`: Handles goals requests
- `habitController.js`: Handles habits requests
- `notificationController.js`: Handles notifications requests
- `recipeController.js`: Handles recipes requests
- `taskController.js`: Handles tasks requests
- `weightController.js`: Handles weight goals and logs requests
- `workoutController.js`: Handles workouts, exercises, and progress photos requests

### Routes

Routes define the API endpoints and connect them to controller methods. They are responsible for:

- Defining API endpoints
- Connecting endpoints to controller methods
- Documenting API endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI

All routes are located in the `routes/` directory:

- `daysSinceRoutes.js`: Defines days since events endpoints
- `goalRoutes.js`: Defines goals endpoints
- `habitRoutes.js`: Defines habits endpoints
- `notificationRoutes.js`: Defines notifications endpoints
- `recipeRoutes.js`: Defines recipes endpoints
- `taskRoutes.js`: Defines tasks endpoints
- `weightRoutes.js`: Defines weight goals and logs endpoints
- `workoutRoutes.js`: Defines workouts, exercises, and progress photos endpoints

## Benefits of MVC Architecture

The MVC architecture provides several benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Modularity**: Components can be developed and tested independently.
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application.
4. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation.
5. **Scalability**: The application can be easily extended with new features.

## API Documentation

API documentation is generated using Swagger/OpenAPI. The documentation is available at `/api-docs` when the server is running.

## Future Improvements

While the MVC architecture has been fully implemented, there are still some areas that could be improved:

1. **Testing**: Add unit tests for models and controllers
2. **Validation**: Implement more robust input validation
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and error messages
4. **Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization
5. **Logging**: Implement a more comprehensive logging system
