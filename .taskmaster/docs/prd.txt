# Food Page Navigation Fix - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement
The food.html page has critical navigation issues that prevent users from accessing the sidebar menu and bottom navigation. The page was previously stuck on "Processing..." due to infinite JavaScript loops, and after fixing those loops, the navigation elements are non-functional.

## Current Issues
1. **Sidebar Menu Button**: The hamburger menu button (â˜°) does not respond to clicks
2. **Bottom Navigation**: Navigation items in the bottom bar don't work properly
3. **Processing Loop**: Previously resolved infinite loops in JavaScript that caused page loading issues
4. **Event Listener Conflicts**: Multiple scripts (sidebar.js, sidebar-updater.js) are conflicting with each other

## Root Cause Analysis
- Button type="submit" instead of type="button" causing form submission behavior
- Multiple JavaScript files attaching conflicting event listeners
- Event listeners being overridden by subsequent script executions
- Timing issues with DOM ready events and script loading order

## Success Criteria
1. Sidebar menu button opens the sidebar when clicked
2. Sidebar closes when clicking the overlay or pressing Escape key
3. Bottom navigation items navigate to correct pages
4. No JavaScript errors or infinite loops
5. Navigation works consistently across page reloads
6. Mobile-responsive navigation behavior

## Technical Requirements
1. Fix button type attribute from "submit" to "button"
2. Resolve event listener conflicts between sidebar scripts
3. Ensure proper script loading order and timing
4. Implement robust event listener attachment that survives script conflicts
5. Test navigation functionality thoroughly
6. Maintain existing page functionality while fixing navigation

## Implementation Approach
1. Identify and fix HTML button type issues
2. Resolve JavaScript event listener conflicts
3. Implement direct event listener attachment as fallback
4. Test sidebar open/close functionality
5. Test bottom navigation functionality
6. Verify no regressions in existing features

## Testing Strategy
1. Manual testing of sidebar button clicks
2. Testing sidebar close via overlay and Escape key
3. Testing bottom navigation item clicks
4. Browser console log verification
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing
6. Mobile responsiveness testing
