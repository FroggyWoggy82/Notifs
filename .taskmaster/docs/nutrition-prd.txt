# Nutrition Field Debugging and Fixing Project

## Project Overview
Fix all problematic nutrition fields in the food tracking application to ensure comprehensive nutrition data can be saved and persisted correctly.

## Problem Statement
Several nutrition fields are not working correctly:

### Critical Issues
1. **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)** - causes 500 API errors when saving
2. **Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)** - causes 500 API errors when saving  
3. **Vitamin B3 (Niacin)** - causes 500 API errors when saving
4. **Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)** - has API issues, values don't persist
5. **Trans Fat** - loads correctly but doesn't save new values
6. **Selenium** - user reported that changing selenium to 200 for chicken thighs didn't save

### Current Status
- 47 out of 49 nutrition fields are working (96% success rate)
- Need to achieve 100% functionality for all nutrition fields
- User expects all fields to work reliably

## Technical Context
- Frontend: HTML forms with JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js API with database
- Current implementation has comprehensive field mapping but some API endpoint issues
- Some fields may have database schema mismatches or validation issues

## Success Criteria
1. All vitamin B fields (B1, B2, B3, B5) save and persist correctly
2. Trans fat field saves new values and persists
3. Selenium field saves and persists correctly for all ingredients
4. No 500 errors when saving any nutrition field
5. All nutrition values persist when reopening edit forms
6. Comprehensive testing confirms 100% field functionality

## Technical Requirements
1. Investigate API endpoint issues for problematic fields
2. Check database schema for field name mismatches
3. Implement proper error handling and validation
4. Test each problematic field individually
5. Verify field mapping between frontend and backend
6. Ensure consistent behavior across all ingredients

## Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality for working fields
- Cannot break current nutrition editing system
- Must be backwards compatible with existing data
- Should handle edge cases and validation errors gracefully

## Deliverables
1. Fixed API endpoints for all vitamin B fields
2. Working trans fat save functionality
3. Reliable selenium field persistence
4. Comprehensive test suite for all nutrition fields
5. Documentation of field mappings and API requirements
