# Changes Made to Fix Workout Exercise History

## Issue

The workout exercise history data was not being displayed correctly on the live Railway deployment. The API endpoints for fetching the last log for exercises and exercise preferences were returning 404 errors, while they worked fine on the local environment.

## Root Cause

The required database tables (`exercise_logs`, `workout_logs`, and `exercise_preferences`) were not properly created on the Railway deployment. Additionally, the API routes were not properly registered in the `railway-combined-server.js` file that is used for the Railway deployment.

## Changes Made

1. Created separate route files for better organization and maintainability:
   - `routes/exercise-routes.js` - Contains new API endpoints for exercise-related functionality
   - `routes/compatibility-routes.js` - Contains compatibility routes that match the original API paths

2. Added the following API endpoints:
   - `/api/exercise/preferences/:exerciseId` - Get preferences for a specific exercise (new path)
   - `/api/exercise/lastlog/:exerciseId` - Get the last log for a specific exercise (new path)
   - `/api/exercise/check-tables` - Check if the required tables exist
   - `/api/exercise-preferences/:exerciseId` - Compatibility route for the original path
   - `/api/workouts/exercises/:id/lastlog` - Compatibility route for the original path

3. Created a migration script (`migrations/create_exercise_tables.js`) to create the required tables if they don't exist:
   - `workout_logs` - Stores workout session data
   - `exercise_logs` - Stores individual exercise performance data
   - `exercise_preferences` - Stores user preferences for exercises

4. Added code to run the migration script when the server starts

5. Created a standalone script (`run-exercise-migration.js`) to run the migration manually

6. Updated documentation in README.md with instructions for running the migration

## How to Test

1. Deploy the changes to Railway
2. Access the `/api/exercise/check-tables` endpoint to verify that the tables exist
3. Open the workout tracker and start a workout from a template
4. Verify that the "Prev" column shows the correct values for exercises with previous logs

## Fallback

If the tables still don't exist after deployment, you can run the migration manually:

```
node run-exercise-migration.js
```
