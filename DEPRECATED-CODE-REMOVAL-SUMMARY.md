# Deprecated Code Removal Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the deprecated code removal process that was performed on the project. The goal was to improve code readability, reduce file sizes, and make maintenance easier by removing commented-out and unused code.

## What Was Done

1. **Removed Commented-Out CSS Files in food.html**:
   - Removed commented-out CSS files that were no longer needed
   - Removed commented-out sections that were explaining why certain files were commented out

2. **Removed Commented-Out JavaScript Files in food.html**:
   - Removed commented-out JavaScript files that were replaced by consolidated fixes
   - Removed commented-out individual fixes that were replaced by consolidated fixes

3. **Created Scripts for Future Cleanup**:
   - Created `remove-deprecated-code.js` to remove commented-out code from all files
   - Created `clean-food-html.js` to specifically clean up the food.html file
   - Created `identify-unused-files.js` to identify JavaScript and CSS files that are not referenced
   - Created `identify-unused-functions.js` to identify functions that are defined but never called

4. **Created Documentation**:
   - Created `DEPRECATED-CODE-REMOVAL.md` with detailed instructions on how to continue the cleanup process
   - Created this summary document to document what was done

## Files Modified

1. **food.html**:
   - Removed commented-out CSS files
   - Removed commented-out JavaScript files
   - Removed commented-out sections explaining why files were commented out
   - Removed commented-out individual fixes

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Readability**:
   - Removed distracting commented-out code
   - Made it easier to understand what code is actually being used

2. **Reduced File Sizes**:
   - Removed unnecessary commented-out code
   - Made files smaller and faster to load

3. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Removed confusion about which code is active
   - Made it easier to understand the codebase

## Next Steps

To continue the deprecated code removal process, follow the instructions in the `DEPRECATED-CODE-REMOVAL.md` file. Here's a summary of the next steps:

1. **Run the Scripts**:
   - Run `identify-unused-files.js` to identify unused files
   - Run `identify-unused-functions.js` to identify unused functions
   - Run `remove-deprecated-code.js` to remove commented-out code from all files

2. **Manual Cleanup**:
   - Remove unused files identified by `identify-unused-files.js`
   - Remove unused functions identified by `identify-unused-functions.js`
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality
   - Remove empty files
   - Update references to removed files

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the application to make sure everything still works
   - Check for console errors
   - Test all features

## Conclusion

The deprecated code removal process has made significant improvements to the codebase. By removing commented-out and unused code, the codebase is now more readable, smaller, and easier to maintain. The scripts and documentation created during this process will make it easier to continue the cleanup process in the future.
