# Deprecated Code Removal

This document explains the process of removing deprecated code from the project to improve code readability, reduce file sizes, and make maintenance easier.

## Overview

The project has accumulated a significant amount of deprecated code over time, including:

1. Commented-out CSS and JavaScript files in HTML files
2. Commented-out code blocks within JavaScript files
3. Unused functions and variables
4. Duplicate functionality across multiple files

This document provides a step-by-step guide to safely remove this deprecated code.

## Scripts

The following scripts have been created to help with the deprecated code removal process:

1. **remove-deprecated-code.js**: Removes commented-out code from all files in the project
2. **clean-food-html.js**: Specifically cleans up the food.html file
3. **identify-unused-files.js**: Identifies JavaScript and CSS files that are not referenced in any HTML files
4. **identify-unused-functions.js**: Identifies functions that are defined but never called

## Step 1: Backup Your Code

Before running any of the scripts, make sure to create a backup of your code:

```bash
# Create a backup of the entire project
cp -r Notifs Notifs_backup
```

## Step 2: Identify Unused Files

Run the `identify-unused-files.js` script to identify JavaScript and CSS files that are not referenced in any HTML files:

```bash
node identify-unused-files.js
```

This will create a file called `unused-files.txt` that lists all the unused files in the project. Review this file to make sure that none of the listed files are actually used (e.g., dynamically loaded).

## Step 3: Identify Unused Functions

Run the `identify-unused-functions.js` script to identify functions that are defined but never called:

```bash
node identify-unused-functions.js
```

This will create a file called `unused-functions.txt` that lists all the unused functions in the project. Review this file to make sure that none of the listed functions are actually used (e.g., called dynamically or used as event handlers).

## Step 4: Clean Up the Food HTML File

Run the `clean-food-html.js` script to clean up the food.html file:

```bash
node clean-food-html.js
```

This script will:

1. Remove commented-out CSS and JavaScript files
2. Remove commented-out sections
3. Remove scripts that have been consolidated
4. Remove CSS files that have been consolidated

## Step 5: Remove Deprecated Code from All Files

Run the `remove-deprecated-code.js` script to remove deprecated code from all files in the project:

```bash
node remove-deprecated-code.js
```

This script will:

1. Remove commented-out code blocks
2. Remove commented-out lines
3. Remove commented-out script and link tags

## Step 6: Manual Cleanup

After running the scripts, there may still be some deprecated code that needs to be manually removed. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Remove Unused Files**: Delete the files listed in `unused-files.txt` that you've confirmed are not used.

2. **Remove Unused Functions**: Remove the functions listed in `unused-functions.txt` that you've confirmed are not used.

3. **Consolidate Duplicate Functionality**: Look for files with similar functionality and consolidate them.

4. **Remove Empty Files**: Delete any files that are empty or contain only comments.

5. **Update References**: Make sure that all references to removed files are also removed.

## Step 7: Testing

After removing deprecated code, thoroughly test the application to make sure that everything still works as expected. Pay special attention to:

1. **Page Loading**: Make sure all pages load without errors.
2. **Functionality**: Test all features to make sure they still work.
3. **Console Errors**: Check the browser console for any errors.

## Best Practices for Future Development

To prevent the accumulation of deprecated code in the future, follow these best practices:

1. **Don't Comment Out Code**: Instead of commenting out code, delete it. You can always retrieve it from version control if needed.

2. **Use Version Control**: Make sure all code is committed to version control before making significant changes.

3. **Regular Cleanup**: Schedule regular cleanup sessions to remove deprecated code.

4. **Document Decisions**: Document why code was removed or changed to help future developers understand the codebase.

5. **Use TODOs**: Instead of leaving commented-out code, use TODO comments to indicate future work.

## Conclusion

Removing deprecated code is an important part of maintaining a healthy codebase. By following the steps in this document, you can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
