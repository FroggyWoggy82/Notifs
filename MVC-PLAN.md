# MVC Architecture Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to fully implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for the Notification Project.

## Current Status

- **Partially Implemented**: The MVC architecture has been partially implemented with models, controllers, and routes for tasks and weight features.
- **Server File**: The server.js file has been updated to use the modular structure.
- **Dependencies**: Swagger dependencies have been added for API documentation.

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Route Files Conversion

Convert the remaining route files to follow the MVC pattern:

- [x] `weightRoutes.js` - Already converted
- [x] `taskRoutes.js` - Already converted
- [ ] `goals.js` → `goalRoutes.js`
- [ ] `daysSince.js` → `daysSinceRoutes.js`
- [ ] `workouts.js` → `workoutRoutes.js`
- [ ] `habits.js` → `habitRoutes.js`
- [ ] `recipes.js` → `recipeRoutes.js`

### 2. Create Controller Files

Create controller files for the remaining features:

- [x] `weightController.js` - Already created
- [x] `taskController.js` - Already created
- [ ] `goalController.js`
- [ ] `daysSinceController.js`
- [ ] `workoutController.js`
- [ ] `habitController.js`
- [ ] `recipeController.js`

### 3. Create Model Files

Create model files for the remaining features:

- [x] `weightModel.js` - Already created
- [x] `taskModel.js` - Already created
- [ ] `goalModel.js`
- [ ] `daysSinceModel.js`
- [ ] `workoutModel.js`
- [ ] `habitModel.js`
- [ ] `recipeModel.js`

### 4. Update Notification Handling

Move notification-related code from server.js to dedicated files:

- [ ] Create `controllers/notificationController.js`
- [ ] Create `models/notificationModel.js`
- [ ] Create `routes/notificationRoutes.js`

### 5. Testing

- [ ] Test each feature to ensure it works with the new architecture
- [ ] Verify API documentation is working correctly

## Implementation Priority

1. Notification handling (most critical for app functionality)
2. Goals feature (core feature)
3. Habits feature (frequently used)
4. Workouts feature
5. Days Since feature
6. Recipes feature

## Benefits of Completing the MVC Implementation

- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application
- **Documentation**: API documentation through Swagger
