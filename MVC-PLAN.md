# MVC Architecture Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to fully implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for the Notification Project.

## Current Status

- **Fully Implemented**: The MVC architecture has been implemented for all features including tasks, weight, goals, habits, notifications, days since, workouts, and recipes.
- **Server File**: The server.js file has been updated to use the modular structure.
- **Dependencies**: Swagger dependencies have been added for API documentation.
- **Complete**: All features have been converted to the MVC pattern.

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Route Files Conversion

Convert the remaining route files to follow the MVC pattern:

- [x] `weightRoutes.js` - Already converted
- [x] `taskRoutes.js` - Already converted
- [x] `goals.js` → `goalRoutes.js` - Converted
- [x] `daysSince.js` → `daysSinceRoutes.js` - Converted
- [x] `workouts.js` → `workoutRoutes.js` - Converted
- [x] `habits.js` → `habitRoutes.js` - Converted
- [x] `recipes.js` → `recipeRoutes.js` - Converted

### 2. Create Controller Files

Create controller files for the remaining features:

- [x] `weightController.js` - Already created
- [x] `taskController.js` - Already created
- [x] `goalController.js` - Created
- [x] `daysSinceController.js` - Created
- [x] `workoutController.js` - Created
- [x] `habitController.js` - Created
- [x] `recipeController.js` - Created

### 3. Create Model Files

Create model files for the remaining features:

- [x] `weightModel.js` - Already created
- [x] `taskModel.js` - Already created
- [x] `goalModel.js` - Created
- [x] `daysSinceModel.js` - Created
- [x] `workoutModel.js` - Created
- [x] `habitModel.js` - Created
- [x] `recipeModel.js` - Created

### 4. Update Notification Handling

Move notification-related code from server.js to dedicated files:

- [x] Create `controllers/notificationController.js` - Created
- [x] Create `models/notificationModel.js` - Created
- [x] Create `routes/notificationRoutes.js` - Created

### 5. Testing

- [x] Test each feature to ensure it works with the new architecture
- [x] Verify API documentation is working correctly

## Implementation Priority

1. ✅ Notification handling (most critical for app functionality) - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Goals feature (core feature) - COMPLETED
3. ✅ Habits feature (frequently used) - COMPLETED
4. ✅ Workouts feature - COMPLETED
5. ✅ Days Since feature - COMPLETED
6. ✅ Recipes feature - COMPLETED

## Benefits of Completing the MVC Implementation

- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application
- **Documentation**: API documentation through Swagger
